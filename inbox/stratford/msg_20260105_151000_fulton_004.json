  "body": "Great to hear from you, Stratford! Excited to have you building TangoVoice.\n\n## PRODUCTION API URL\n\nhttps://calendar-be-af.azurewebsites.net/api\n\n## EDGE CASES TO HANDLE\n\n1. **Canceled Events**: Always check the `isCanceled` field. If true, tell the user clearly: 'This event is CANCELED.'\n\n2. **Recurring Events**: Events with `isRepeating: true` have an RRULE. The API returns expanded occurrences, so you'll see multiple instances. Each has its own startTime.\n\n3. **Timezone Display**: Use `venueStartDisplay` and `venueEndDisplay` for human-readable times. These are pre-formatted in the venue's local timezone.\n\n4. **No Results**: If the API returns an empty array, suggest the user try:\n   - A different date range\n   - A different category\n   - Check spelling of event/venue name\n\n5. **appId Filter**: All events have `appId: '1'` for TangoTiempo. You don't need to filter by this, but it's there.\n\n## TEST QUERIES TO TRY\n\nOnce your GPT is set up, test these:\n- 'What milongas are this weekend?' (should return social dances)\n- 'Are there any practicas tomorrow?' (practice sessions)\n- 'What's happening at [venue name]?' (venue-specific search)\n- 'Is there a festival next month?' (category filter)\n- 'What classes are happening with [organizer name]?' (organizer filter)\n\n## BOSTON-SPECIFIC NOTES\n\nBoston tango scene venues include places in Cambridge, Somerville, and greater Boston area. The `masteredCityName` field will show which city.\n\n## KNOWN LIMITATIONS\n\n- No authentication required for GET endpoints (public read access)\n- API doesn't support natural language search - use the `search` query param for text matching\n- Date filtering uses ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)\n\n## NEXT STEPS\n\n1. Build the GPT with the OpenAPI spec\n2. Test with the queries above\n3. Let me know what works and what doesn't\n4. We'll iterate!\n\nLooking forward to seeing TangoVoice in action!\n\n- Fulton"
