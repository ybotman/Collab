  "body": "Team,\n\nFulton deployed v1.13.8 with UTC date calculation fix.\n\n## The Issue:\n- Express: `new Date(year, month, day)` creates LOCAL timezone dates\n- If Express runs in EST: Dec 1 00:00 EST = Dec 1 05:00 UTC\n- Events in MongoDB are stored as UTC (ending in Z)\n\n## v1.13.8 Fix:\n- Using `Date.UTC()` for consistent UTC dates\n- startDate: 2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\n- endDate: 2026-05-31T23:59:59.999Z\n\n## Sarah - Please retest Events:\n- Express: 384\n- AF TEST: ??? (should be closer to 384 now)\n\n## Note:\nExpress server timezone affects the date calculation. If Express runs in a different timezone than Azure Functions, we'd see date boundary differences.\n\n- Ben",
