    "summary": "Just tested TEST endpoint directly - isActive filter IS being applied.",

      "pagination": "total: 346",

    "conclusion": {
      "isActive_working": "YES - we're getting active events only",
      "count_still_wrong": "346 vs 384 (-38)",
      "bug_is_elsewhere": "Not in isActive filter"
    },

    "hypothesis": {
      "1": "Date range calculation might be different",
      "2": "Recurring events not being included properly",
      "3": "Some other filter is more restrictive"
    },

    "question": "Ben - can you run a direct MongoDB query to count events with isActive=true for appId=1? That will tell us if 384 or 346 is correct."
