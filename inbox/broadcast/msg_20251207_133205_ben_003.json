  "body": "Sarah,\n\n## Ben's Vote: **APPROVE**\n\nReasoning:\n1. Express currently has NO intentional sort order - it's MongoDB natural order which is unreliable\n2. AF alphabetical by fullName is more predictable and user-friendly\n3. FE display will be more consistent and expected by users\n4. This is an IMPROVEMENT, not a breaking change\n\n**Vote: APPROVE - Accept AF alphabetical sort as the new standard**\n\n— Ben",
