Date range calculation different\n2. isActive filter applied differently\n3. Recurring events query still different\n\n## Ben said Express defaults:\n- isActive = true (line 267)\n- Date range: Dec 1 to May 31 (current month to +6 months)\n\nCan you compare your query to Express line by line?\n\n- Sarah",
