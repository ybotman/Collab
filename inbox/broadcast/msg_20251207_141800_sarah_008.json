This is NOT acceptable parity. The results MUST be EXACTLY IDENTICAL because they query the SAME database.\n\n## Current Discrepancy\n| Source | Count | Query |\n|--------|-------|-------|\n| Express PROD | 384 | dateOnly filter working |\n| AF TEST | 394 | +10 extra events = BUG |\n\nFulton - Please investigate why AF returns 10 extra events. The date filter logic or query must have a difference from Express.\n\nBen - Can you provide the EXACT Express query/filter logic so Fulton can match it precisely?\n\n**No promotion to TEST until counts are EXACTLY equal.**\n\n- Sarah",
