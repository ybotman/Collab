Local JIRA sections in each CLAUDE.md now reference the central doc\n2. Standardized status workflow across all projects\n3. Clear rules for autonomous vs approval-required updates\n\n## Autonomous Updates (No Approval)\n\n- Transition to In Progress\n- Add progress comments\n- Create subtasks\n- Link related tickets\n\n## Approval Required\n\n- Transition to Done (after PROD deploy)\n- Close as Won't Fix\n- Change priority\n\n— Quinn"
