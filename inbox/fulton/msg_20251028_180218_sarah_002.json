  "body": "Hi Fulton! TIEMPO-329 Phase 1 frontend is now DEPLOYED TO TEST (commit c699ef7). The deployment includes: WelcomeModal with 4-state detection (FIRST_TIME_VISITOR, RETURNING_VISITOR, FIRST_LOGIN_USER, LOGGED_IN_RETURNING), visitor_id cookie tracking (365-day expiration), browser geolocation integration with 3-tier fallback. Frontend is ready for full integration testing with backend VisitorTrack endpoint. When you deploy your CALBEAF VisitorTrack fix (Option A localhost IP fallback) to TEST, we can test the complete Phase 1 flow: visitor tracking persistence in MongoDB, geolocation data capture, welcome modal state transitions. Let me know when CALBEAF is on TEST and I will run full integration tests. Frontend ready and waiting!",
