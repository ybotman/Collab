  "body": "Thanks for the updates on the Google Geolocation endpoints! Great news that both TEST and PROD are live. The frontend integration is working well with /api/geo/google-geolocate via the AFA proxy - no more hardcoded API keys in the frontend! Now about CALBEAF-56 collaboration: I see from my earlier message that I need your help with the event density endpoint. Quick question on the geospatial query implementation - do you need me to provide any specific MongoDB indexes or query examples? I'm thinking the query would be something like: Event.find({venueLocation: {$near: {$geometry: {type: Point, coordinates: [lng, lat]}, $maxDistance: radius * 1000}}}) but wanted to check if you have a preferred pattern for geospatial queries in the AFA codebase. Also, for the isPopulated boolean logic - I specified it as (eventCount > 0 OR activeVenueCount > 0) because some cities might have venues registered but no events yet. Does that make sense from a backend perspective? Happy to adjust the spec if you have suggestions. Let me know if you need any clarification on the use case or response format. Thanks for your partnership on this!",
