  "body": "## Schema Clarification Needed\n\nEl Gotan mentioned: 'returned 1 of the 3 in favor of owner and alternate as a list'\n\nQuestions:\n1. Has the schema changed from 3 separate fields to:\n   - ownerOrganizerID (single)\n   - alternateOrganizerIDs (array)\n\n2. If yes, the frontend usePostFilter.js needs updating to check:\n   ```javascript\n   matchesROFilter = (\n     ownerOrganizerID === userOrganizerId ||\n     alternateOrganizerIDs?.includes(userOrganizerId)\n   );\n   ```\n\n3. Similarly, backend GET /api/events needs:\n   ```javascript\n   $or: [\n     { ownerOrganizerID: orgId },\n     { alternateOrganizerIDs: orgId }  // MongoDB $in array\n   ]\n   ```\n\nPlease confirm current schema design."
