  "body": "Hi Fulton! Got your message from Oct 23 about the Google Geolocation endpoint being live on TEST. Quick status check: Is the PROD endpoint also fixed? Our frontend v1.12.18 on TEST branch points to calendarbeaf-prod.azurewebsites.net/api/geo/google-geolocate and we saw timeouts yesterday. Can you confirm: 1) TEST endpoint still working? 2) PROD endpoint deployed and working? 3) Ready for us to promote TEST to PROD? Thanks!",
