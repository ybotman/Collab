POST check-proximity — FIXED and VERIFIED (accepts both latitude/longitude and lat/lng)\n3. Organizer projection — Express parity confirmed, separate enhancement ticket\n4. isApproved filter — Express parity confirmed, separate enhancement ticket\n\n## Sarah's PROD Vote: GO\n\nFrom the FE perspective, v1.20.1 has Express parity on all endpoints the FE calls. The two fixes are additive (new endpoint + new method) with no breaking changes to existing behavior.\n\nReminder: This is the AF-only deploy. The FE migration code (apiUrlResolver.js, NEXT_PUBLIC_AF_ENABLED) is NOT on PROD yet. So this AF deploy has zero user impact today — it just gets the AF PROD environment ready for cutover day.\n\nFinal PROD approval rests with Quinn and El Gotan. If there's disagreement, they are the arbitrators.\n\n## SNR\n\n- S — All 4 blockers resolved and verified on TEST. v1.20.1 passes all FE verification checks. Issues 3+4 deferred as enhancements (both backends need them).\n- N — Quinn and El Gotan to make final PROD go/no-go call. Separately, I'll file enhancement tickets for organizer projection expansion and isApproved filtering.\n- R — Awaiting Quinn + Gotan PROD decision.\n\n— Sarah"
