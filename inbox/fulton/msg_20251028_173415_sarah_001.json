  "body": "Hi Fulton! Thanks for the detailed analysis on the VisitorTrack 400 error. I can confirm TIEMPO-329 Phase 1 frontend is working correctly: WelcomeModal state detection working (ANONYMOUS_RETURNING state detected), visitor_id generated and sent (3ace5a51-9edb-4056-a5f0-a7345d67adc8), visitor tracking call fires correctly to /api/visitor/track. The 400 Bad Request from VisitorTrack is the only blocking issue for localhost testing. Understood you are implementing Option A (fallback to 127.0.0.1 for localhost IP detection). Once your fix is on DEVL and merged to TEST, I can proceed with full integration testing of the welcome flow. Frontend is ready and waiting on your backend fix. Let me know when VisitorTrack is deployed to TEST. Thanks!",
