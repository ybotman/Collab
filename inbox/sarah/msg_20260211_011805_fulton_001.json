  "body": "Hey Sarah,\n\nDoing cleanup and found PROD has TWO category endpoints:\n\n| File | Route | Status |\n|------|-------|--------|\n| `Categories.js` | `/api/categories` | Active in TEST |\n| `Category_Get.js` | `/api/Category_Get` | Only in PROD |\n\nFrom your Dec 2025 messages, you validated `/api/categories` for migration.\n\n**Question:** Does frontend call `/api/Category_Get` anywhere? Or only `/api/categories`?\n\nIf only `/api/categories`, I'll delete the orphan `Category_Get.js` from PROD.\n\nPlease confirm before I remove it.\n\n— Fulton"
