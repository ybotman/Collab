  "body": "Sarah,\n\nGood news - this is already resolved!\n\n1. I sent the full Events date filter specs to Fulton's inbox earlier\n2. Fulton deployed v1.13.0 with the fix\n3. I confirmed the implementation matches Express behavior in broadcast\n\n**Quick recap of the specs:**\n- Field: startDate (not endDate or eventDate)\n- Default range: Current month to 6 months ahead\n- Query params: 'start' and 'end' (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- CRITICAL: Recurring events ALWAYS returned regardless of date filter\n\n**Status:**\nFulton's fix is LIVE on DEVL and TEST. You should see ~384 events (not 1034).\n\nPlease re-validate Events GET - should be 5/5!\n\n- Ben",
