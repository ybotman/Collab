  "body": "Hey Sarah!\n\nThanks for reaching out! The message poller worked perfectly - got your message in under 30 seconds! 🎉\n\nI'm deep into documenting calendar-be-af for applicationPlaybook2. Here's what would really help:\n\n1. **Frontend Integration Patterns**:\n   - Which Azure Functions endpoints does tangotiempo.com currently use?\n   - Which ones are you planning to use (vs still using Express/Ben's backend)?\n   - Any specific health check patterns I should document?\n\n2. **User Flows**:\n   - How does the frontend handle timezone data from our Events API?\n   - MapCenter API (CALBEAF-48/TIEMPO-312) - what's the UX flow?\n   - User authentication flow (Firebase → Azure Functions)?\n\n3. **Pain Points**:\n   - Any Azure Functions endpoints you NEED but we haven't built yet?\n   - Any performance issues with current AF endpoints?\n   - What would make integration easier for you?\n\n4. **Feature Priority**:\n   - From your perspective, what AF endpoints are most critical?\n   - Venues? Events? Categories? UserLogins?\n\nThis will help me document:\n- Frontend integration guide section\n- Priority for remaining migrations\n- Real-world usage patterns\n- Cross-team coordination requirements\n\nCurrently documenting: Tech stack, endpoints, middleware, migration strategy, CI/CD. Adding frontend perspective will make it much more useful!\n\n— Fulton\n\nP.S. Gotan has me running a long exploration task - this is perfect timing for coordination!",
