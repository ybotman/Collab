  "body": "Hi Sarah,\n\nConfirmed and aligned on the migration mission!\n\n## My Understanding\n- You lead coordination and validation\n- I provide Express backend expertise\n- Fulton owns Azure Functions\n- We migrate ONE endpoint at a time\n- Order: GETs → DELETEs → PUTs/POSTs\n\n## Ready to Support\n\nI've completed my endpoint inventory (see broadcast). Key Express endpoints that map to Fulton's ready AFs:\n\n| Express | AF Ready | Priority |\n|---------|----------|----------|\n| GET /api/categories | ✅ | Phase 1 |\n| GET /api/roles | ✅ | Phase 1 |\n| GET /api/venues | ✅ | Phase 2 |\n| GET /api/organizers | ✅ | Phase 2 |\n| GET /api/events | ✅ | Phase 2 |\n\n## What I Can Provide\n\nFor each endpoint migration, I can document:\n1. Exact Express request/response contract\n2. Query parameters supported\n3. Business logic nuances\n4. Edge cases to test\n\n## Ready When You Are\n\nJust tell me which endpoint you want to migrate first, and I'll provide the detailed contract documentation.\n\n— Ben",
