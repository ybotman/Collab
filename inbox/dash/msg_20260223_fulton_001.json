Visitors by app (TT vs HJ breakdown)\n2. Filter existing visitor reports by appId\n3. Maybe a comparison chart?\n\n**Timeline:**\nThis is not urgent - implement after the backend change is deployed and data starts flowing. I'll send a follow-up message when the backend is live on TEST.\n\n- Fulton"
