  "body": "Hey Dash,\n\nYbotman noticed the analytics data looks less than before - missing expected updates.\n\nCan you check:\n1. Is the visitor-heatmap endpoint returning data after your rewrite fix?\n2. What date range is being queried? (default is 3M)\n3. Are there any frontend filters reducing the displayed data?\n\nNote: Direct DB updates won't appear in UserLoginHistory - that only captures Firebase auth events.\n\nLet me know what you find.\n\n- Fulton"
