# Session Handoff: Sarah @ 2026-02-19

## Current Status
Session startup - reviewing TIEMPO-381 location pill issue, received new message from Fulton about recurring events.

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: TIEMPO-381
- **Status**: In progress - investigating location pill regression

## What I Did This Session
- Checked inbox: message from Fulton (Feb 18) about recurring events not rendering on Boston calendar
- Checked latest handoff from Feb 17 session
- Confirmed local dev server running on port 3001
- Identified relevant files for location pill:
  - `src/app/contexts/GeoLocationContext.js` - locationDisplayText
  - `src/app/components/UI/LocationInfo.js` - location pill UI
  - `src/app/components/UI/SiteHeader.js` - nearestCity display

## Pending Investigation
1. **TIEMPO-381**: Location pill showing lat/long instead of city name "Boston ± 200mi"
2. **Fulton's message**: Recurring event 692ddc10c6ecccc498a249b1 not rendering (API returns it but UI doesn't show)

## Next Session Should
1. Have user check pill visibility on local/test/prod (URLs provided)
2. Investigate locationDisplayText computation in GeoLocationContext.js
3. Check how nearestCity is fetched/displayed in SiteHeader.js
4. After pill fix, investigate Fulton's recurring events issue (RRULE expansion)

## Key Decisions Made
- None yet - session just started

## Context for Future Me
- Previous session (Feb 17) fixed Boston route by preventing UserLocationLoader from overwriting locked coordinates
- Regression: city name display broken, showing raw lat/long
- Two issues to resolve: location pill display + recurring events rendering
- Fulton verified API returns the recurring event correctly - issue is frontend rendering
