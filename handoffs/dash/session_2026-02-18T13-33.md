# Session Handoff: Dash @ 2026-02-18

## Current Status
Working on CALOPS UI improvements - drawer menu reorganization in progress

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: None specific (general UI improvements)
- **Status**: in_progress

## What I Did This Session
- Fixed Organizers page select parameter (spaces→commas) - deployed to PROD
- Added columns to Organizers page: Events count, User Email, User Last Login, Created, Updated
- Fixed createdAt to fallback to ObjectId timestamp
- Restructured Users page tabs: All, NU, RO, RA, SA, FB+User, FB Only, User Only
- Removed Container wrapper from Users page for full width
- Fixed Data Health page - matched backend keys, added Firebase tab
- Fixed healthData[key] mapping (was healthData.issues[key])
- Started drawer menu reorganization (Dashboard section first, Geo at end of Data)

## Next Session Should
1. Complete drawer menu reorganization (commit pending change)
2. Push drawer changes to DEVL
3. Test Data Health page with new Firebase checks
4. Consider merging DEVL changes to main/PROD

## Key Decisions Made
- Data Health uses root-level keys, not nested under 'issues'
- Drawer menu grouped: Dashboard first, then Data section
- Users page uses role-based tabs matching MongoDB roles collection

## Context for Future Me
- On DEVL branch with uncommitted drawer menu change (Dashboard section first, Geo at end of Data)
- Backend (calendar-be-af) has new Firebase checks: firebaseUsersWithoutEmail, firebaseUsersDuplicateEmail, userloginsDuplicateEmail
- PROD has organizer page fixes but not the new Data Health/drawer changes
