# Session Handoff: Dash @ 2026-02-11

## Current Status
CALOPS-41/42 complete. User Activity + Data Health pages merged to PROD. Waiting on Fulton for backend PROD deployment.

## Active Tickets
- **CALOPS-41**: Data Health Dashboard — DONE, merged to PROD
- **CALOPS-42**: User Activity Page — DONE, merged to PROD

## What I Did This Session

### CALOPS-41 Data Health Dashboard
- Created /dashboard/data-health page
- Summary cards: Total Issues, Critical, Warnings, Info
- 3 tabs: Events, Venues, Users & Organizers
- 7 issue categories with expandable detail tables
- Force Refresh button (bypasses 5-min cache)

### CALOPS-42 User Activity Page
- Created /dashboard/user-activity page
- Summary cards: Total Users, Active (30d), Stale, Never Logged In
- 3 tabs: All Users, Stale Users, Never Logged In
- Search by name/email/ID
- Expandable user cards with organizer/event details

### Route Conflict Resolution
- Discovered Azure reserves "admin" keyword in URL paths
- Changed routes from /api/admin/* to /api/ops/*
- Coordinated with Fulton for backend route changes
- Updated CALOPS frontend API client

### Agent Identity Updates
- Renamed from Quinn to Dash
- User renamed from BananaBoat to El Gotan
- Created inbox/dash/ in agent-messages
- Moved CALOPS messages from quinn to dash
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new team roster (Atlas, Claw, Porter)

## Deployment Status
| Env | Backend | Frontend |
|-----|---------|----------|
| LOCAL | ✅ | ✅ |
| TEST | ✅ | ✅ |
| PROD | ❌ waiting | ✅ merged |

## Next Session Should
1. Check inbox for Fulton's PROD deployment confirmation
2. Verify PROD endpoints work after deployment
3. Consider CALOPS-38/39 (cloud cost dashboards) if assigned

## Messages Sent
- To Fulton: PROD deployment request for /api/ops/* endpoints

## Key Files Modified
- src/app/dashboard/user-activity/page.js (NEW)
- src/app/dashboard/data-health/page.js (NEW)
- src/lib/api-client/admin.js (routes updated)
- src/components/AdminLayout.js (nav items added)
- CLAUDE.md (agent identity + team roster)

## Context for Future Me
- Backend endpoints: /api/ops/user-activity, /api/ops/data-health
- Azure Functions reserves "admin" keyword - avoid it in routes
- Fulton is the backend contact for calendar-be-af
- El Gotan prefers autonomous operation - just do it, report in SNR
