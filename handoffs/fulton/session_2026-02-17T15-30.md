# Session Handoff: Fulton @ 2026-02-17T08:15

## Current Status
Comprehensive database reconciliation completed. Action plan ready for Gotan's review.

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: None (data reconciliation task)
- **Status**: awaiting approval

## What I Did This Session
- Read previous handoff (database naming mixup discovered)
- Created 10 reconciliation documents in `docs/`
- Built 8 reconciliation scripts in `scripts/`
- Analyzed 236 event deltas, 860 venue deltas, 64 userlogin deltas, 27 organizer deltas
- Created focused report (Dec 15 - Apr 20) with action items
- Documented RRULE/frontend data flow
- Built comprehensive action plan organized by organizer
- Verified "sdf" test events (Adriana Pinto, Andi Babbs) are junk data

## Key Findings
- **92 "deleted" events** are old RRULE-expanded events (replaced, not lost)
- **Milonga Sal Azul** (35 weekly) intentionally deleted by Gotan
- **Alex added monthly "Sal Azul Milonga"** to replace
- **Blue Milonga, Milton/Corin, Simonida** all added legitimate events
- **Guillermo's NOCHE DE PRÁCTICA** (9 events) need RRULE replacement check
- **Test data** ("sdf", "aa", "12", "324") should be deleted

```

## Next Session Should
1. Review `docs/RECONCILIATION-ACTION-PLAN.md` with Gotan
2. Confirm decisions on ⚠️ items (Guillermo, Roger Wood, Vicky)
3. Check if Guillermo's NOCHE DE PRÁCTICA has RRULE replacement
4. Execute Phase 1: Fix local.settings.json naming
5. Execute Phase 2: Sync LIVE → DEV one row at a time
6. Delete confirmed junk data

## Key Decisions Made
- LIVE (TangoTiempo) is source of truth
- DEV (TangoTiempoProd) should be synced to match LIVE
- "sdf" type events are test junk - delete
- Old RRULE-expanded events were replaced, not lost

## Database Truth
| Name | Database | Is |
|------|----------|-----|
| LIVE | TangoTiempo | Production (tangotiempo.com) |
| DEV | TangoTiempoProd | Local development |

## Context for Future Me
- Azure app `calendarbeaf-prod` → TangoTiempo (correct)
- Azure app `calendar-be-af` → TangoTiempoProd (local dev)
- Vercel points to calendarbeaf-prod (correct)
- local.settings.json naming is backwards (MONGODB_URI_PROD points to dev!)
- DO NOT execute any changes without Gotan approval
