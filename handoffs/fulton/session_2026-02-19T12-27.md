# Session Handoff: Fulton @ 2026-02-19T12:25

## Current Status
TEST merged to PROD but GitHub Actions deployment FAILED due to azure/functions-action@v1 version issue.

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: Analytics time filtering
- **Status**: code merged, deployment blocked

## What I Did This Session
- Added flexible time range param to Analytics_VisitorHeatmap
  - Format: {number}{unit} - e.g., 1H, 3H, 24H, 7D, 2W, 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Yr, 2Yr, All
  - Default: 3M
- Updated swagger documentation
- CRK assessment: 92% confidence (admin-only endpoints)
- Merged TEST → PROD (commit 6bbf3f14)
- Deployment failed: `azure/functions-action@v1` version not found

## Next Session Should
1. Fix GitHub Actions workflow:
   - Change `Azure/functions-action@v1` to `Azure/functions-action@v1.5.2`
   - Or try re-running (might be transient)
2. Verify PROD deployment succeeds
3. Check inbox for messages

## Key Decisions Made
- Flexible range params instead of hardcoded (user requested)
- CRK passed for PROD deploy (admin-only changes)

## Context for Future Me
- Last successful PROD deploy was Feb 16 (3 days ago)
- Feb 11 failures were ESLint errors (different issue)
- Today's failure is GitHub Actions infra issue - NEW problem
- Code is on PROD branch, just needs deploy to Azure
