# Session Handoff: Fulton @ 2026-02-11T15:03

## Current Status
CALOPS-41 ops/* endpoints deployed to PROD - complete

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: CALOPS-41
- **Status**: completed

## What I Did This Session
- Fixed Azure route conflict: `admin` keyword reserved at ANY URL position
- Changed routes from `admin/ops/*` to `ops/*`
- Updated swagger.json (tag Admin → Ops)
- Deployed to TEST and verified
- CRK assessment (92% confidence)
- Fixed ESLint errors (duplicate $ne key, unused variable)
- Deployed to PROD and verified
- Sent message to Dash about new route URLs

## Next Session Should
1. Check inbox for messages
2. Backport ESLint fixes to DEVL, TEST, main branches
3. Update JIRA ticket CALOPS-41 with completion status
4. Consider adding more ops endpoints if needed

## Key Decisions Made
- Used `ops/` prefix instead of `admin/ops/`: Azure reserves `admin` keyword everywhere in URL
- Anonymous auth kept for ops endpoints: read-only, internal dashboard use

## Context for Future Me
- PROD URL: https://calendarbeaf-prod.azurewebsites.net/api/ops/*
- TEST URL: https://calendarbeaf-test.azurewebsites.net/api/ops/*
- ESLint fix commits only pushed to PROD branch - need to sync to other branches
- Remaining ESLint warnings in other files (Events.js, Cloudflare.js, etc.) are pre-existing
