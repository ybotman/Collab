## Current Status
Deep analysis of database reconciliation complete. Found VICKY'S 70th BIRTHDAY event mystery. Ready to compare 15-day changes.

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: None (database reconciliation task)
- **Status**: in_progress

## What I Did This Session
- Verified backups exist (TangoTiempo: 1,575, TangoTiempoProd: 1,670)
- Determined cutover date: ~January 29, 2026
- Created FULL-ANALYSIS-REPORT.md with complete divergence analysis
- Created CHANGES-BY-ORGANIZER.md showing per-organizer actions
- Updated OVERVIEW.md with explicit database names and cutover info
- Investigated CRUD logging (Azure Functions do NOT log CRUD to MongoDB)
- Discovered daily Azure backup exists but connection string not in local settings
- Found VICKY'S 70th BIRTHDAY PARTY event (ID: 6992c09fd7738f471b9a25c9):
  - Created: Feb 16, 2026 2:00 AM in TangoTiempo
  - EXISTS in: TangoTiempo.events_backup_2026-02-17T05-46-30-560Z
  - NOT in: TangoTiempo.events (current) or TangoTiempoProd.events
  - NO EVIDENCE of who/why deleted - DO NOT ASSUME Vicky deleted it
- Listed all event backup collections across both databases

## CRITICAL: READ ONLY
**Gotan explicitly stated: NO CRUD - only reads. Do not make any database changes.**

## Next Session Should

1. **Read this handoff**
2. **Compare events_backup_2026-02-17T05-46-30-560Z to current TangoTiempo.events and TangoTiempoProd.events**
   - Focus on changes during the 15-day period (Jan 29 - Feb 17)
   - Group by organizer shortname
   - READ ONLY - no updates
3. Determine what happened to Vicky's event
4. Document all findings before any approvals

## Key Database Mapping (REMEMBER THIS)

| Database | Env Var | Currently Points To |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| TangoTiempo | MONGODB_URI_TEST | tangotiempo.com (LIVE) - WRONG |
| TangoTiempoProd | MONGODB_URI_PROD | test.tangotiempo.com (TEST) - WRONG |

User changes during 15 days went to TangoTiempo (because LIVE site pointed there).
These changes need to be reconciled INTO TangoTiempoProd before swap.

## Scripts Created This Session
- scripts/reconciliation-analysis.js
- scripts/per-organizer-report.js
- scripts/search-birthday.js
- scripts/compare-event.js
- scripts/check-society-tangobar.js
- scripts/analyze-vicky-event.js

## Files Updated/Created
- docs/reconciliation/OVERVIEW.md (updated with cutover date, explicit DB names)
- docs/reconciliation/FULL-ANALYSIS-REPORT.md (NEW)
- docs/reconciliation/CHANGES-BY-ORGANIZER.md (NEW)

## Context for Future Me
- The "spaghetti" is the backwards database naming
- Cutover happened ~Jan 29, 2026
- 99.4% of organizer events are identical between DBs
- AZUL has 6 events with isActive mismatch
- 17 userlogins need to be copied to TangoTiempoProd
- VICKY'S 70th BIRTHDAY event is a mystery - don't assume deletion was intentional
- Gotan pushed back on assumptions - stick to FACTS and EVIDENCE only
