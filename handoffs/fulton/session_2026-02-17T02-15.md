# Session Handoff: Fulton @ 2026-02-17T02:15

## Current Status
Database naming mixup discovered; reconciliation handoff prepared for next session.

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: None (data reconciliation task)
- **Status**: paused

## What I Did This Session
- Ran PROD→TEST sync (2,620 docs from TangoTiempoProd to TangoTiempo)
- Discovered CRITICAL issue: database naming is backwards
  - `TangoTiempo` = LIVE (used by tangotiempo.com via calendarbeaf-prod)
  - `TangoTiempoProd` = local dev only (NOT live!)
- Verified user's new TEST event (69940a8dc17106d597ef6dcb) is safe
- Did 60-day event comparison: LIVE = PROD counts match
- Created reconciliation handoff doc: `docs/RECONCILIATION-HANDOFF.md`

## Next Session Should
1. Read `docs/RECONCILIATION-HANDOFF.md`
2. Do day-by-day, event-by-event comparison
3. Write results to `docs/RECONCILIATION-RESULTS.md`
4. Identify what needs reconciliation
5. DO NOT make any changes until reconciliation complete

## Key Decisions Made
- NO code changes until we understand full picture
- NO database updates during reconciliation
- Backups exist in TangoTiempo for rollback if needed

## Context for Future Me
- Two Azure Function apps: `calendarbeaf-prod` (live) vs `calendar-be-af` (local)
- Live site Vercel env: `NEXT_PUBLIC_AF_URL=https://calendarbeaf-prod.azurewebsites.net`
- Backup from today's sync: `events_backup_2026-02-17T05-46-30-560Z`
- User went to bed ~2am EST
