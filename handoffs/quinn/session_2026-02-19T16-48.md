# Session Handoff: Quinn @ 2026-02-19T15:30

## Current Status
Resolved Fulton's high-priority block on Analytics_OrganizerActivity - function now live on TEST

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: None (ad-hoc CalOps request)
- **Status**: completed

## What I Did This Session
- Ran session startup protocol, read previous handoff (iTerm arrangements)
- Reviewed inbox: Fulton blocked on Analytics_OrganizerActivity 404
- Deep dive investigation into calendar-be-af function
- Found root cause: function file existed but was NOT imported in src/app.js
- Sent solution to Fulton's inbox with one-line fix
- Fulton applied fix, deployed to TEST
- Verified endpoint working: 11 events analyzed, 351ms response

## Next Session Should
1. Check inbox for messages
2. Outstanding work from previous sessions:
   - DNAV: Create 9 Epics for DentalNavigator project
   - System Announcements: Create JIRA Epic/tickets (Atlas approved architecture)
   - Reconciliation: May need to run Sarah's queries to compare databases

## Key Decisions Made
- Stayed in coordinator role: diagnosed issue but sent fix to Fulton rather than editing his code directly

## Context for Future Me
Azure Functions v4 with "main": "src/app.js" requires ALL function files to be explicitly require()'d in the entry point. Missing require = function never loads = 404. This is a common gotcha when adding new functions.
