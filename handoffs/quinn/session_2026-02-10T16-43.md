# Session Handoff: Quinn @ 2026-02-10T17:15

## Current Status
Completed cross-app architecture docs and handoff system implementation

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: None (operations/documentation)
- **Status**: completed

## What I Did This Session
- Created `docs/MASTERCALENDAR-ARCHITECTURE.md` (34KB comprehensive doc)
- Created handoff directory structure in agent-messages repo
- Created `HANDOFF-PROTOCOL.md` and `HANDOFF-TEMPLATE.md`
- Added `/handoff` command to all agent CLAUDE.md files:
  - Quinn (CLAUDE.md at root)
  - Sarah (tangotiempo.com/CLAUDE.md)
  - Fulton (calendar-be-af/CLAUDE.md)
  - Cord (harmonyjunction.org/CLAUDE.md)
- Researched memory persistence (Claude-mem, Mem0, native auto-memory)

## Next Session Should
1. Check inbox for messages
2. Commit handoff protocol changes to git
3. Test startup protocol by reading this handoff
4. Consider adding JIRA roadmap to architecture doc

## Key Decisions Made
- **Self-handoff over centralized state**: Each agent owns their continuity
- **Markdown format**: Human-readable, git-friendly
- **Git-based storage**: History preserved, easy to debug

## Context for Future Me
- All agent CLAUDE.md files now have startup protocol (read handoff + check inbox)
- All agent CLAUDE.md files now have /handoff command for session end
- Handoff files go in: agent-messages/handoffs/{agent}/session_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM.md
- Architecture doc covers: iTerm cockpit, dev-runner, branch gates, all agent personas, messaging stats
