# Session Handoff: Quinn @ 2026-02-19T16:45

## Current Status
Created TANGOLOGY iTerm arrangement as copy of MasterCalendar - user to customize panes

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: None
- **Status**: completed

## What I Did This Session
- Ran session startup protocol, read previous handoff (DNAV JIRA setup)
- Reviewed pending messages (Atlas approved System Announcements, Sarah's reconciliation queries)
- Helped user document iTerm window arrangements
- Discovered existing arrangements: MasterCalendar, Arrangement (02/19/2026), 4 Tiled Images
- Duplicated MasterCalendar arrangement to TANGOLOGY using PlistBuddy

## Next Session Should
1. Check inbox for messages
2. If user wants to document TANGOLOGY pane layout, help capture that
3. Outstanding work from previous sessions:
   - DNAV: Create 9 Epics for DentalNavigator project
   - System Announcements: Create JIRA Epic/tickets (Atlas approved architecture)
   - Reconciliation: May need to run Sarah's queries to compare databases

## Key Decisions Made
- Used PlistBuddy to duplicate iTerm arrangement: Faster than manual recreation

## Context for Future Me
iTerm arrangements are stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist under "Window Arrangements" key. User has multiple dev environment layouts they want to manage.

User needs to quit/restart iTerm2 to see the new TANGOLOGY arrangement in the menu.
