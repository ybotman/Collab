# Session Handoff: Quinn @ 2026-02-10T16:45

## Current Status
Created comprehensive cross-app architecture documentation and session handoff system

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: None (operations/documentation work)
- **Summary**: Cross-app documentation and memory persistence
- **Branch**: N/A (root-level work)
- **Status**: completed

## What I Did This Session
- Created `docs/MASTERCALENDAR-ARCHITECTURE.md` (34KB comprehensive doc)
- Added sections: Local Dev Environment, Branch Strategy, Agent Team, Messaging System
- Archived `calendar-be/public/IFE-Tracking/` to `wtf/IFE-Tracking/`
- Researched memory persistence solutions (Claude-mem, Mem0, native auto-memory)
- Created handoff directory structure in agent-messages repo
- Designed session handoff protocol for cross-session continuity

## What's Blocked / Waiting
- Nothing blocked

## Next Session Should
1. Check inbox for messages from other agents
2. Update other agent CLAUDE.md files with startup/handoff protocol
3. Consider adding JIRA roadmap section to architecture doc
4. Test handoff system with Sarah/Fulton

## Key Decisions Made
- **Handoff files over centralized state**: Simpler, human-readable, git-native
- **Markdown over JSON for handoffs**: Easier for humans to read/edit
- **Per-agent handoff directories**: Each agent owns their state

## Files Modified
- `docs/MASTERCALENDAR-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Created comprehensive cross-app doc
- `agent-messages/handoffs/` - Created directory structure
- `agent-messages/handoffs/HANDOFF-TEMPLATE.md` - Created template

## Context for Future Me
- The architecture doc covers: system overview, tech stack, local dev (iTerm/dev-runner),
  branch strategy (DEVL/TEST/PROD gates), user personas, data architecture, auth,
  FB conditioner pipeline, backup/recovery, caching strategy, full agent team roster,
  messaging system with stats (300+ messages)
- User wants memory persistence across Claude Code sessions - this handoff system is the solution
- All agent inboxes are in `/Users/tobybalsley/Documents/AppDev/MasterCalendar/agent-messages/inbox/`

## Messages Sent (Pending Response)
- None
