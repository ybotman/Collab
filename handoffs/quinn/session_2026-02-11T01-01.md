# Session Handoff: Quinn @ 2026-02-11 (late night)

## Current Status
CALOPS-42 User Activity page built and on feature branch. Ready for merge to DEVL after testing.

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: CALOPS-42 (User Activity View)
- **Status**: Built, on feature branch, needs testing

## What I Did This Session (Part 2)

### CALOPS-35 Mobile Work (Early Session)
- Created EventMobileCards.js
- Updated AllEventsTab with ResponsiveTableWrapper
- Made DataGrids use dynamic height (calc(100vh - X))
- Pushed to DEVL and TEST (v1.2.2)

### CALOPS-42 User Activity (Late Session)
- Created new page: /dashboard/user-activity
- Created admin.js API client for /api/admin/* endpoints
- Added "User Activity" to navigation (2nd item after Dashboard)
- Features:
  - Summary cards: Total, Active, Stale, Never Logged In
  - 3 tabs: All Users, Stale Users, Never Logged In
  - Search by name/email/ID
  - Expandable user cards with details
  - Click to see organizer info and events

## Branches Status
- **DEVL**: Has v1.2.2 mobile improvements (commit 453e181)
- **TEST**: Merged from DEVL (commit e40f06e)
- **feature/CALOPS-42-user-activity**: User Activity page (commit f77e76d) - NOT MERGED YET

## Backend Dependency
- Fulton built: GET /api/admin/user-activity
- Requires backend deployed with this endpoint for the page to work
- Check if backend is deployed to TEST/PROD

## Next Session Should
1. Test User Activity page with running backend
2. Merge feature/CALOPS-42-user-activity to DEVL
3. Consider building Data Health Dashboard (uses /api/admin/data-health)
4. CALOPS-38/39: Cloud cost tracking dashboards

## Files Created/Modified (CALOPS-42)
- NEW: src/app/dashboard/user-activity/page.js
- NEW: src/lib/api-client/admin.js
- MODIFIED: src/components/AdminLayout.js (nav item)
- MODIFIED: src/lib/api-client/index.js (export adminApi)

## Notes
- User Activity page uses date-fns for formatting
- Organizer/events loading happens on card expansion (lazy load)
- authLevel: 'function' on backend endpoint - may need function key
