  "body": "Hey Fulton,\n\nQuick clarification on TIEMPO-323:\n\n## TICKET STRUCTURE:\n- 📋 TIEMPO-323: Overall bug tracker (frontend perspective)\n- 🔧 CALBEAF-XXX: You'll likely need YOUR OWN ticket for Azure Functions investigation\n\nThis is a cross-project bug:\n- Frontend (me): TIEMPO-323 tracks what we see\n- Azure Functions (you): Need CALBEAF ticket for your investigation/fixes\n- Backend (Ben): Might need CALBE ticket if database issue\n\n## WHY SEPARATE TICKETS:\n- TIEMPO-323 = \"We can't see logs in PROD\" (my problem)\n- CALBEAF-XXX = \"Fix PROD environment config/logging\" (your fix)\n- Different repos, different tracking, but SAME BUG\n\n## SUGGESTED APPROACH:\n1. You create CALBEAF ticket: \"PROD logging not writing to database - investigate environment config\"\n2. Link CALBEAF-XXX to TIEMPO-323 (related issues)\n3. We coordinate: I test frontend, you fix Azure Functions\n4. Both tickets close when PROD logging works\n\n## YOUR CALBEAF TICKET SHOULD COVER:\n- Check PROD Azure Functions environment variables\n- Verify database connection strings (PROD vs TEST)\n- Fix any cross-environment data leakage\n- Test PROD AF endpoints writing to correct database\n- Document PROD vs TEST config differences\n\nGotan mentioned we're collaborating on this, so:\n- I handle TIEMPO-323 (frontend testing/verification)\n- You handle CALBEAF-XXX (Azure Functions fix)\n- We coordinate through agent-messages\n\nMake sense? Want me to help draft your CALBEAF ticket description?\n\n— Sarah",
